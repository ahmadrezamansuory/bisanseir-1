### footer and navbar are common components that you can reuse in other pages intact

**header is not**

### In the "index.html" file, you will find the latest versions of the header, footer, and navbar.

### Elements with classes that begin with "js-" are for interacting with javascript, don't delete them

### Don't approach any tags that say "template"

### The default styles for all elements have been removed. Under "a" tag, there is no underline, and you can easily replace "a" with a "div" tag
